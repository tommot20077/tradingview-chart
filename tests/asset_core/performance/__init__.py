"""Performance tests package.

Description of what the package covers:
This package contains performance tests for various components of the `asset_core`
library. It focuses on evaluating the efficiency, scalability, and resource usage
(e.g., CPU, memory) of critical operations, including model creation, serialization,
validation, and concurrent processing.

Preconditions:
- The `asset_core` library components are available for testing.
- Relevant performance measurement tools (e.g., `memory_profiler`) are installed.

Expected Result:
- The performance tests ensure that the `asset_core` library meets performance
  benchmarks and operates efficiently under various loads.
