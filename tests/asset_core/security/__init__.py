"""Security tests package.

Description of what the package covers:
This package contains comprehensive tests for security-related functionality
within the `asset_core` library. It focuses on critical areas such as input
sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS,
path traversal) and secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., API keys,
personal information) to prevent leaks.

Preconditions:
- The `asset_core` library components are available for testing.
- Relevant security features are implemented in the core library.

Expected Result:
- The security tests ensure that the `asset_core` library is robust against
  common security threats and handles sensitive information securely.
