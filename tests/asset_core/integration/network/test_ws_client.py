        reconnection, including connection status, error counts, and
        callback functionality.

        Preconditions:
        - Client with established connection.

        Steps:

        - Allow reconnection to occur.
        - Verify state is properly recovered.

        Expected Result:
        - Client should recover to functional state.
        - All callbacks should work after recovery.
        - Internal state should be properly reset.
