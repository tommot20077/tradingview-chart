    These tests verify the end-to-end behavior of the `Trade` model,

    and string representation.

        """Test complete trade lifecycle.

        Description of what the test covers:
        Verifies the full lifecycle of a `Trade` object, from instantiation
        to calculation of derived properties, serialization to dictionary,
        and string representation.

        Preconditions:
        - None.

        Steps:
        - Create a `Trade` instance with all relevant fields.
        - Assert the correctness of calculated `volume`.
        - Convert the `Trade` object to a dictionary using `to_dict()`.
        - Assert the correctness of `volume` in the dictionary.
        - Convert the `Trade` object to its string representation.
        - Assert that key information is present in the string representation.

        Expected Result:
        - The `Trade` object should behave correctly throughout its lifecycle,
          with consistent data across different representations.

        Description of what the test covers:
        Verifies that `Trade` objects with identical content are considered equal
        and have the same hash, while objects with different content are not equal.

        Preconditions:
        - None.

        Steps:
        - Create two `Trade` objects with identical data.
        - Assert that they are equal (`==`).
        - Create a third `Trade` object with different data.
        - Assert that it is not equal to the first two.

        Expected Result:
        - `Trade` objects should correctly implement equality and hashing based on their content.
